| ![left 50% Book Cover]({{ "/assets/BookCover.png" | absolute_url }}) | We are collecting a group of folks from around the world to collaborate. |

The intention of gathering such a diverse group of people to be involved in this project, is to prove that working on something remotely can be fun and productive.

This team is way more diverse then anyone will probably encounter in the real world. If we can pull it off, by creating great content, and having fun while doing it - anyone can. |

Are you interested in helping us write?
